# Kubernetes Examples

This repository provides example questions used in preparation for [CKAD](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/).

## Getting started

> Note: It is assumed you are in the . directory.

It is recommend to run python applications in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). To do so, run the following:

```python
python3 -m venv .venv # create virtual env
source .venv/bin/activate # use virtual env
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install requirements
```

Documentation is served using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). To view documents in your local browser, run the following:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
